# TVB Data

Various demonstration datasets for use with The Virtual Brain are provided here.

Here you will find:
* compatible file/folder structures that can be uploaded thorugh the web interface of TVB; and
* the default datasets used when working in ``console`` or `library` mode.

This repository should be treated as a regular Python module.
Possibly what you want to do after cloning it locally is:

    cd tvb-data/
    python setup.py develop

to have it linked into your current Python environment.
